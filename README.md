# A reference notebook for the first 2 hours with a new dataset

While preparing for an internal transfer interview. My two coworkers and I noticed that the first hour or two of DS work when encountering a new (and cleaned!) dataset are very repeatable. So we decided to make this reference notebook to include some of the most commonly used functions.

Eric, the most organized (by farrrr) out of us three, wrote a TDS article explaining these: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-essential-data-science-reference-notebook-d71ebba922b6
